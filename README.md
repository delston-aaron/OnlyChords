OnlyChords üéµ
A modern, intuitive web application designed for musicians to create, edit, and manage chord sheets with ease. Born from the frustration of manually formatting chords in standard text editors, OnlyChords provides a streamlined, two-step workflow to separate lyric writing from chord placement.

Live Demo: https://onlychordsapp.netlify.app/

‚ú® Features
Two-Step Workflow: A dedicated <textarea> for hassle-free lyric writing and a separate, structured editor for precise chord placement.

Intelligent Chord Placement: Simply "arm" a chord from the palette and "stamp" it anywhere above your lyrics. The app handles all the spacing automatically.

Dynamic Transposition: Instantly transpose all chords in your sheet up or down with the click of a button. The key signature and chord palette update automatically.

Auto-Save to Browser: Your entire session, including lyrics, chords, and key signature, is automatically saved to local storage. Close your browser and pick up right where you left off.

Expandable Chord Palette: Access all diatonic chords for the selected key, plus an expandable chromatic palette for any accidentals or non-diatonic chords.

Keyboard Shortcuts: Power-user shortcuts for a faster workflow (1-7 to arm chords, Esc to disarm).

Dark & Light Modes: A sleek, modern interface with a beautiful dark mode, complete with a gradient-translucent UI.

Export Ready: Copy a perfectly formatted, monospace-ready version of your chord sheet to the clipboard or print it directly from the browser.
